# Information-Processing-Technology-for-Monitoring-and-Warning-of-Bridge-Ship-Collision
## 1.Background

### 1.1Bridge ship collision
The occurrence of ship collisions with bridges is increasing day by day, and the hazards and damages caused by ship collisions with bridges are becoming more and more serious.
### 1.2Collision Avoidance System
- Bridge ship collision prevention can be divided into passive collision prevention and active collision prevention.
- Passive collision avoidance - improve the resistance of the bridge and increase the buffer device
- Active collision prevention - by establishing bridge ship collision warning system
### 1.3Information dissemination
Due to technical reasons, most of the centers in China are not only incompatible with the existing maritime information yesterdays, but also difficult to share information even in the local LAN.

# Method
This project focuses on the automatic processing and release technology of early warning and assessment information in bridge ship collision monitoring and warning system, in order to improve the response speed of bridge ship collision monitoring and warning system and the timeliness and relevance of its information release, and to reduce human efforts.
